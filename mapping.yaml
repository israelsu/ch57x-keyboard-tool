# Normal keyboard orientation is when
# buttons are on the left side and knobs are on the right.
# However, you may want to use the keyboard in another orientation.
# To avoid remapping button positions in your head, just set it here.
# Possible values are:
#   (horizontal)
#   - 'normal': buttons on the left, knobs on the right
#   - 'upsidedown': buttons on the right, knobs on the left
#   (vertical)
#   - 'clockwise': buttons on the top, knobs on the bottom
#   - 'counterclockwise': buttons on the bottom, knobs on the top
orientation: normal

# Different keyboard models have different numbers of buttons and knobs.
# Set it here for proper handling.
# Count rows and columns with the keyboard in normal orientation (knobs on the right)
rows: 1
columns: 3
knobs: 1
# Layers are sets of alternative key mappings.
# The current layer is changed using a button on the side of the keyboard
# and displayed with LEDs on top (only for the moment of changing).
# All keyboards I saw had three layers, but I suppose other variants exist.
layers:
  - buttons:
      # Multimedia commands are supported but
      # cannot be mixed with normal keys and modifiers.
